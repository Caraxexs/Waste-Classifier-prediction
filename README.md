Waste Classifier
This project is a machine learning-based waste classification system that predicts and classifies waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories. The system helps in efficient waste management by automating the sorting process, making it easier for recycling and waste disposal industries.

Features
Waste Classification: Classifies waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories.

Machine Learning Model: Uses machine learning algorithms to train on waste data for accurate predictions.

Waste Management: Provides automated waste sorting solutions for recycling and disposal.

Web Interface: Allows users to interact with the system via a user-friendly web interface.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for the backend.

TensorFlow/Keras: Machine learning libraries for training the classification model.

Flask: Web framework to deploy the model and interact with the frontend.

HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For building the frontend interface.

MongoDB/SQL: For storing user data, waste records, and tracking statuses.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your machine.

Install required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Install the necessary ML libraries like TensorFlow or Keras if they are not included:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install tensorflow keras
Running the Application
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Caraxexs/wasteclassifier.git
cd wasteclassifier
Training the Model:

Navigate to the directory containing your training script, e.g., train_model.py, and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train_model.py
Ensure the dataset (data.csv or another format) is in place before training the model.

Run the Flask App:

To run the web interface and model integration:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Access the app in your browser at http://localhost:5000.
